 Markdown Editor

## Introduction

**Vara** [Estonian](Estonian for "Paddock") is a subdistrict of the district of PÃµhja-Tallinn (Northern Tallinn) in Tallinn, A markdown editor developed by flutter, it also integrates an interface for uploading blogs directly, which is convenient for individuals to write articles.

My current tool for writing articles is [Typora] (https://typora.io/), which is very beautiful and very easy to use, but since it needs to be manually upload to CMS after writing, it is very troublesome to manage, plus There is no iOS app on Typora, so I decided to pick one by myself. Of course, in fact, the most important thing is that flutter has launched version 2.0, and wants to try the so-called one-time coding six platform release.

The demand I want is this:
1. Able to upload to the CMS system with one click, and support one click to update articles
2. Apps of the same style can be written and viewed simultaneously on macOS and iOS
3. Support inserting pictures and uploading pictures automatically

## Quick start

1. Clone from git

2. Do `flutterÂ createÂ .Â ` in your project directory

3. Do `flutter packages get` in your project directory
